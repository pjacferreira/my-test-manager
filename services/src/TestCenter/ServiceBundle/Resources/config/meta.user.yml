# TODO How to handle Password and Confirmation
# Possible Solutions:
# 1. Create a virtual field (never loaded or saved to the database) and
#    require it to be equal to the actual field.
# 2. Add a property to the password field, which states that this field
#    requires confirmation (and allow any forms that use this to create,
#    automatically, the confirmation field)
