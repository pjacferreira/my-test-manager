Open Source Project, licensed under the [AGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), directed towards organizing and simplifying the Management of [User Acceptance Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) or [Functional Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing).

It utilizes a client/server model, in which the server components provide a an API that is used to manage the required infrastructure, and the client components, provide the User Interface.
Formerly, based on [SYMFONY PHP Framework](http://symfony.com/), it now utilizes the [PHALCON PHP Framework](http://phalconphp.com/en/) as the base for both the Server and Client Components. The current UI is an HTML Web Application that will, be cross media compatible, using [SEMANTIC-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
